# XDB-Electron-Binding-Energies
Electron binding energies for each element based on the [X-Ray Data Booklet](https://xdb.lbl.gov/) from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
The original dataset is provided in pdf form, which is cumbersome for importing this dataset into software.

This repo gives the same electron binding energies from the XDB in various machine-readble formats (Excel, csv, json) to more easily import the data into software.
