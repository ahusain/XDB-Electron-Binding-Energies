# XDB-Electron-Binding-Energies
This repository gives the electron binding energies from the [X-Ray Data Booklet](https://xdb.lbl.gov/) in various machine-readable formats (Excel, csv, json) to easily import the data into software. The original dataset from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is provided in pdf form, which is not machine-readable, and can be found [here](https://xdb.lbl.gov/Section1/Table_1-1.pdf).
