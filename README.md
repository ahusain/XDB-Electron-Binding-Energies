# XDB-Electron-Binding-Energies
This repository presents the electron binding energies from the [X-Ray Data Booklet](https://xdb.lbl.gov/) in three machine-readable formats (*.xlsx*, *.csv*, *.json*) to easily import the data into software. The original dataset from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is provided in pdf form, which is not directly machine-readable, and can be found [here](https://xdb.lbl.gov/Section1/Table_1-1.pdf).
